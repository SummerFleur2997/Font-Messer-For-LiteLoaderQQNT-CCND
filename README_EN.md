# Font-Messer-For-LiteLoaderQQNT-CCND

Create messed fonts. Used to create new fonts for the [LiteLoaderQQNT-CCND](https://github.com/MapleRecall/LiteLoaderQQNT-CCND)(Author [@MapleRecall](https://github.com/MapleRecall)).

`Python 3.9` REQUIRED, no guarantee for proper working in any other versions. Before use, please install the following LIBS:

```python
pip install fontTools
pip install brotli
```
When installed successfully, use your python to run the file _main.py_, and then you can see the messed fonts in folder _/output_.

Can only generate the styles EXCEPT _chaos_, cause I haven't finished it yet, so I seperated it in the folder _CHAOS_

> [!WARNING]
> THE SCRIPT FOR GENERATING _CHAOS_ MAY TAKE A VERY VERY VERY LONG TIME, AND NEED A MASSIVE MANUAL OPERATION.
